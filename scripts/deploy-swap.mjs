/**
 * Atomic blue/green deploy swap for the static build. Ported from jmrp.io,
 * which already used it; it was brought here for a specific reason.
 *
 * WHY: the vhost serves `root /var/www/mcp.jmrp.io/dist`, so while `dist` was
 * a real directory, ANY `astro build` published instantly — including the one
 * that runs inside `pnpm check`. The origin ended up with the new content and
 * the Cloudflare edge with the old one, because the purge lives in the deploy
 * and nobody had called it. The 2026-08-22 GEO audit caught the site exactly
 * like that: `/` serving an earlier version with a climbing `age`, and the
 * sitemap advertising a `lastmod` 3 h newer than the page itself.
 *
 * With blue/green, `dist` is a symlink and a bare build writes to the INACTIVE
 * colour: it publishes nothing. Publishing is the `swap`, a rename(2) over the
 * symlink — atomic, so Nginx never sees a half-written root.
 *
 * `prepare`: picks the inactive color dir (builds/blue|builds/green),
 *   empties it, and prints its relative path to stdout.
 * `swap <dir>`: atomically retargets the `dist` symlink to <dir> using
 *   ln -sfn + rename(2) (via `fs.renameSync`), so Nginx never sees a missing
 *   root. Migrates a legacy `dist` directory to `builds/<color>` on first run.
